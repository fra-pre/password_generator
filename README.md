# Password Generator

This is a simple password generator that allows users to generate secure passwords. It has two options:

<ul><li>Mnemonic PW:  The user enters a memorable phrase and the password generator creates a password based on the first letter of each word. In addition, there is the possibility to add randomized uppercase to the letters and random numbers/special characters. </br> Note:  Punctuation marks are removed before the password is generated, and if numbers are included, they are taken as such.
</li>

<li>Quick PW: The user enters the desired length of the password and the password generator creates a random password with that length.</li></ul>

The password generator also includes a function to copy the generated password to the clipboard.
